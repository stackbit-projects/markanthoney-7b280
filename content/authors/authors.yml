    I have enjoyed over a decade working alongside faculty to design effective
    online learning experiences for college students. Preferred methods include
    backward design, the community of inquiry framework, problem-based and
    team-based learning, and authentic assessment. Mark draws upon his
    experience in instructional design, digital media production. He holds an MA
    in Communication Studies and an MA in Library and Information Science from
    the University of Iowa. I keep trying capture his professional experiences
    here.
